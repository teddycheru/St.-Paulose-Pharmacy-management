         <P>Pharmacy management software is a unified system that manages retail products and medications and automates operations such as stock control, drug dispensing, claims management, billing, and reporting. Such software provides pharmacies with a big picture of the business’s performance and a real-time overview of costs, revenue, and sales (at every location, if it’s a chain).</P>
         <p>
            Usually, pharmacy management software is multipurpose and contains a number of different features. It’s reasonable to build such a system using a modular approach, grouping similar features into independent modules. For example, an inventory management module could contain features for uploading inventory, updating stock levels, and managing supplies, while a document management module could contain features for scanning, storing, and retrieving documents, including Certificates of Medical Necessity (CMN) forms, insurance cards, prescriptions, and workers’ compensation forms.
         </p>
         <p>
            Each pharmacy needs its own set of pharmacy software features and modules. Your choice of functionality should depend on what you want to accomplish. Below, we outline features that can be helpful.

     <section class="main-section" id="Purpose">
        <p>
            The pharmacy management system serves many purposes, including the safe and effective dispensing of pharmaceutical drugs. During the dispensing process, the system will prompt the pharmacist to verify the medication they have filled is for the correct patient, contains the right quantity and dosage, and displays accurate information on the prescription label. Advanced pharmacy management systems offer clinical decision support and may be configured to alert the pharmacist to perform clinical interventions, such as an opportunity to offer verbal counseling if the patient's prescription requires additional education in the pharmacy.

        <p>There are lots of data and documents circulating around a pharmacy. Enable your system to scan, store, and retrieve documents.</p>
         <P>Features to include in a pharmacy data management module:</P>
         <Ul>
             <li>Upload medical data, such as notes from physicians and pharmacists, by scanning and/or entering data manually</li>
             <li>Store and view medical data</li>
             <li>Retrieve medical data</li>

            To get the maximum benefit from your management system, integrate it with the tools you already use. If you integrate with a point of sale (PoS) system, you’ll be able to record transactions and update inventory automatically. To facilitate prescriptions, consider integrating e-prescribing software. It will accelerate the processes of filling, renewing, modifying, and cancelling prescriptions.
